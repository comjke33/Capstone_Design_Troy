[block0]
The program starts by reading an integer `T` from the input.  It also includes error checking to ensure that the input for `T` was successfully read.

[block1]
The program reads a string `S` from the input. It then calls the function `isPalindrome` to determine if the string is a palindrome and stores the result in the variable `result`.  It also initializes a variable `cnt` and prints the values of `result` and `cnt` to the console.

[block2]
The program terminates by returning 0.
