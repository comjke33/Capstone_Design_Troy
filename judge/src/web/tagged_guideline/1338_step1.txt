[func_def_start(0)]
`read_data` function: takes an array of floats `x` and `y`, the number of elements `n`, and pointers to update the sums `sum_logx`, `sum_y`, `sum_logx2`, and `sum_ylogx`.
[rep_start(1)]
The `i` index ranges from 0 to n-1 in the loop.
[self_start(2)]
Inside the loop, `scanf` reads two floats: `x[i]` and `y[i]`.
[self_end(2)]
[self_start(2)]
`lx` is calculated as the natural logarithm of `x[i]`.
[self_end(2)]
[self_start(2)]
`sum_logx` is incremented by `lx`.
[self_end(2)]
[self_start(2)]
`sum_y` is incremented by `y[i]`.
[self_end(2)]
[self_start(2)]
`sum_logx2` is incremented by `lx * lx`.
[self_end(2)]
[self_start(2)]
`sum_ylogx` is incremented by `y[i] * lx`.
[self_end(2)]

[func_def_start(0)]
`calculate_coefficients` function: takes the calculated sums `sum_logx`, `sum_y`, `sum_logx2`, `sum_ylogx`, and pointers to update `a` and `b`.
[self_start(1)]
`b` is calculated as `(5 * sum_ylogx - sum_logx * sum_y) / (5 * sum_logx2 - sum_logx * sum_logx)`.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`a` is calculated as `(sum_y - b * sum_logx) / 5`.
[self_end(1)]

[func_def_start(0)]
`predict_value` function: takes the coefficients `a` and `b`, and the input value `input_x`.
[self_start(1)]
The function returns the predicted value calculated as `a + b * log(input_x)`.
[self_end(1)]
[func_def_end(0)]

[main_def_start(0)]
The `main` function starts.
[self_start(1)]
The float arrays `x` and `y` are declared with a size of 5.
`sum_logx`, `sum_y`, `sum_logx2`, and `sum_ylogx` are initialized to 0.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`read_data` is called with the `x` and `y` arrays, the size 5, and the pointer addresses of the `sum_logx`, `sum_y`, `sum_logx2`, and `sum_ylogx` variables.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`a` and `b` are declared as float variables to store the coefficients.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`calculate_coefficients` is called with the calculated sums `sum_logx`, `sum_y`, `sum_logx2`, `sum_ylogx`, and the address of `a` and `b` to update them.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`input_x` is declared.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`scanf` reads a float from the user and stores it in `input_x`.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
`predict_value` is called with the calculated coefficients `a` and `b`, and the `input_x` value.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
The result of `predict_value` is printed with a precision of 2 decimal places.
[self_end(1)]
[self_start(1)]
The main function returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
